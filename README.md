# yfitops — Name That Spotify V2

A real-time, ultra-low-latency multiplayer music guessing game built for a
hacker-conference environment. A central **Stage** screen projects the music,
synced lyrics, and a Jeopardy-style board; attendees join from their phones and
use a **Mobile** web app as a pure physical buzzer; a host drives everything
from an **Admin** Control Room. The whole system is built defensively around a
zero-trust client model and server-authoritative anti-cheat.

The full design and threat model live in [`design_doc.md`](./design_doc.md);
the spec every build agent worked against is
[`docs/BUILD_CONTRACT.md`](./docs/BUILD_CONTRACT.md).

## Architecture

| Layer            | Tech                                   | Role |
| ---------------- | -------------------------------------- | ---- |
| Backend engine   | Go 1.26                                | Concurrent buzz/scoring/state engine. |
| Network          | WebTransport over QUIC (HTTP/3, UDP)   | No head-of-line blocking on congested venue Wi-Fi; survives IP migration. |
| Real-time cache  | Redis                                  | Atomic single-winner buzz lock (`SET NX`). |
| Persistence      | PostgreSQL                             | Audit log, scores, persistent track/board curation. |
| Frontends        | React 19 + Vite + Tailwind (PWA)       | Stage, Mobile buzzer, Admin control room. |
| Audio            | Spotify Web Playback SDK + Web API     | Stage tab is the "Virtual Device"; Go routes play/pause to it. Go never plays audio itself. |
| Lyrics           | LRCLIB                                  | Synced timestamped lyrics for the karaoke phase. |

Key design constraints (see design_doc §4, §9):

- **Client sanitization (§4A):** mobile clients never receive track title,
  artist, URI, or lyrics — only sanitized `GameState` flags. Reveal/lyrics data
  goes to Stage/Admin only.
- **Server arrival authority (§4B):** buzz ordering uses the server's arrival
  clock; client timestamps are only used for RTT heartbeats.
- **Atomic buzz (§4 / §3.4):** the first buzz to win the Redis lock flips state;
  everyone else gets `buzzResult{won:false}`.
- **Audio isolation (§9):** on buzz, Go sends a `pause` directly to the Stage
  over WebTransport (~20ms) instead of waiting on a Spotify round-trip.

```

## Running the backend

Requires Docker (with Compose). From the repo root:

```bash
cd deploy
cp .env.example .env          # then edit secrets / Spotify creds
make up                       # build + start postgres, redis, gameserver
make logs                     # tail logs
make down                     # stop
```

Or without the Makefile: `docker compose up --build` from `deploy/`.

This brings up three services:

- **postgres** (`postgres:16-alpine`) — runs `deploy/migrations/0001_init.sql`
  on first boot. To (re)apply the schema to an existing volume: `make migrate`.
- **redis** (`redis:7-alpine`) — the atomic buzz lock.
- **gameserver** — the Go engine, listening on:
  - **`:4433/udp`** — WebTransport / QUIC / HTTP3 (note: UDP).
  - **`:8777/tcp`** — plain HTTP: `/healthz`, Spotify OAuth
    (`/auth/spotify`, `/auth/spotify/callback`), and `/cert-hash`.

The server degrades gracefully: if Redis or Postgres are unreachable at boot it
falls back to in-memory implementations and a seeded sample board, logging the
mode of each subsystem (no silent degradation). This means the engine is
demonstrable even without the full data layer.

All env vars are documented in [`deploy/.env.example`](./deploy/.env.example)
and read by `server/internal/config/config.go`.

## Running the frontends

Each app under `web/` is an independent Vite project (Node 24 recommended). For
each of `stage`, `mobile`, `admin`:

```bash
cd web/stage   # or web/mobile, web/admin
npm install
npm run dev     # Vite dev server
npm run build   # production build
```

- **stage** — the central presentation screen. Hosts the Spotify Web Playback
  SDK and shows the board, timer, reveal, and karaoke lyrics.
- **mobile** — the buzzer PWA attendees load via the lobby QR code.
- **admin** — the host Control Room (grading, overrides, kick/ban, skip
  threshold). Gated by `ADMIN_SECRET`.

The apps share types and the transport client from `web/shared/` (a TS mirror of
the Go protocol and scoring contracts).

## Spotify (real audio) — required setup

Real audio playback needs a **Spotify Premium** account on the Stage device and
an app registered at <https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard>:

1. Create an app, copy its Client ID / Secret into `deploy/.env`
   (`SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID`, `SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET`).
2. Add the redirect URI verbatim to the app's allowlist — default
   `http://localhost:8777/auth/spotify/callback`.
3. From the Stage tab, hit `/auth/spotify` on the server (port 8777) to
   authenticate; that tab becomes the routed Virtual Device (design_doc §6, §9).

**Demo / mock fallback:** without Spotify credentials the system still runs end
to end — the engine, buzzing, scoring, state machine, and a seeded sample board
all work — but there is **no real audio**. This is the intended way to develop
and demo the gameplay loop without a Premium account.

## WebTransport self-signed cert (dev flow)

WebTransport over QUIC requires TLS. In dev the server **auto-generates a
self-signed cert** on first boot (`transport.GenerateSelfSigned`) into the
`/certs` volume — a writable cert dir is all you need.

Browsers won't trust that cert by default, so WebTransport clients connect using
`serverCertificateHashes`. The server publishes the cert's base64 SHA-256 at:

```
http://localhost:8777/cert-hash
```

The web transport client (`web/shared/client.ts`) fetches that hash and pins it
when opening the WebTransport session. The cert is persisted in the `certs`
volume so the hash stays stable across restarts (use `make clean` to wipe it).

## Known limitations / not runtime-verified

Honest accounting of what is and isn't proven:

- **Verified:** `docker compose config` parses cleanly, including the critical
  `4433:4433/udp` mapping and the `migrations/` init-bind. The Go server image
  builds from `deploy/Dockerfile.server` (pure Go, static, CGO off). Go unit
  tests cover the fixed contracts (scoring, anticheat, nonce gate).
- **Not runtime-verified (needs manual checking):**
  - A full `docker compose up` with live gameplay end-to-end has **not** been
    run here. Bring it up and watch the gameserver logs for the data-layer mode
    lines.
  - **Real Spotify playback** is untestable without Premium credentials and the
    OAuth flow above — only the mock/no-audio path has been exercised.
  - **WebTransport requires a Chromium-based browser** (Chrome/Edge). Firefox
    and Safari support is incomplete; the self-signed `serverCertificateHashes`
    flow is Chromium-specific. There is no fallback transport.
  - The self-signed cert flow is a **dev convenience**. A real deployment needs
    a proper cert and a reverse proxy / SSL termination story that preserves
    HTTP/3 + UDP (design_doc §11) — not configured here.
